# ETWPM2Monitor2.1 vs SysPM2Monitor2.7
### in this page i will share my tests on both source codes (ETWPM2Monitor2.1 & SysPM2Monitor2.7) against Some Attack Codes (Process/Thread/Code Injection Attacks etc)

ETW is very strong thing for Defenders/BlueTeamers also Sysmon but some security researcher ignored ETW becuse they think ETW is very Noisy ;) which i think that thing 
which you called noisy exactly are things you should focous on them and you will find a lot attack in those Events (change your mindset) , in my opinion only work with Sysmon is not good idea also working only with ETW is not good too so i think we should work with both at the same time for check events then you will have better result.
