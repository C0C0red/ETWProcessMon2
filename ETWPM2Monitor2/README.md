Note: the goal is talking/thinking about how can use ETW as Defender/Blue teamer for Defensive tools like EDR/AVs or your own Tools etc. so does not matter what i did in my C# codes, these codes just is for test to show you how can use ETW as Blue teamer but these things/codes made by my opinion & my focus was on Remote Thread Injection attack also my focus was on those things which i think blue teamers should know them better than before (especially Alarms TAB Events in this tool)  and these code was for Chapter15 of ebook [bypassing AVs by C# Programming], (i will publish ch15 soon ;D) which is about how can use ETW for Defenders/Blue teamers & ... 

Note: in this code we have "Pe-sieve64.exe" & "Hollowshunter.exe" so to use you need to download these exe files & paste them in same folder with ETWPM2Monitor2.exe & i tested ETWPM2Monitor2 with Pe-sieve64.exe (ver 0.2.9.6) & Hollowshunter.exe (ver 0.2.9.6)

md5 info, "exe files are not safe here in github so make your own exe files with C# source by yourself [i recommend]":
