Note: in this code we have "Pe-sieve64.exe" , so to use you need to download these exe files & paste them in same folder with ETWPM2Monitor2.exe & i tested ETWPM2Monitor2 with Pe-sieve64.exe (ver 0.2.9.6)

md5 info, "exe files are not safe here in github so make your own exe files with C# source by yourself [i recommend]":

      34594f427f-708c32b01c-70dc48332e18 => ETWPM2Monitor2.exe (v2.1) [v2.1.41.375] 19,May,2022
      
      
    
    
Note: for "ETWPM2Monitor2.exe" (v2.1) you should use "ETWProcessMon2.exe (v2.1)" tool also for execute exe file you need ".NET Framework 4.5" ;) 

Usage Steps

    Step1 (Run as Admin): ETWProcessMon2.exe > output.txt 

    Step2 (Run as Admin): ETWPM2Monitor2.exe
