Note: in this code we have "Pe-sieve64.exe" & "Hollowshunter.exe" so to use you need to download these exe files & paste them in same folder with ETWPM2Monitor2.exe & i tested ETWPM2Monitor2 with Pe-sieve64.exe (ver 0.2.9.6) & Hollowshunter.exe (ver 0.2.9.6)

md5 info, "exe files are not safe here in github so make your own exe files with C# source by yourself [i recommend]":

      0e5f6bd971-a53f450017-c6967d6549f1 => ETWPM2Monitor2.exe (v2.1)
      
      Note: ETWPM2Monitor2.exe [ver 2.1.21.97]
    
    
Note: for "ETWPM2Monitor2.exe" (v2.1) you should use "ETWProcessMon2.exe (v2.1)" tool also for execute exe file you need ".NET Framework 4.5" ;) 

Usage Steps

    Step1: ETWProcessMon2.exe (Run as Admin)

    Step2: ETWPM2Monitor2.exe (Run as Admin)
